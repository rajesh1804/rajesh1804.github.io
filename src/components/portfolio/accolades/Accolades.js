              Upon going undergoing a rigorous selection process, I was inivited to participate in this hackathon.
              At this hackathon, we are teamed with a bunch of students from various universities and are tasked to solve a real-world problem for nonprofits within 24 hours.
              My team and I developed a web portal that automates most of the manual work done by the NGO, thus increases their efficiency in minimal time.
              We reached the finals of this competition after 2 presentation rounds - technical & non-technical.<br />
