              <strong>Description: </strong><br />
              o During my internship, I was given the task to build a one-stop web portal using React.js, that replaces the existing MS-Excel 
              reports, thus making it much more easier and efficient for the end user to consume the same data.
              This multi-page and multi-section dashboard along with  <i>'filter'</i> functionality was build using the famous concepts 
              React-Router & Redux.
              o For each section of the dashboard, there happens a GET call to get data using the <i>'fetch'</i> API in React.js .
              This dashboard also caches the data already fetched from API calls in an active session, and uses it to dynamically to 
              replace an API call when the user tried to hit an already hit API endpoint.<br />
