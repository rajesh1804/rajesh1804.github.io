                    o At Bluecat, I designed and deployed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to streamline real-time 
                    network diagnostics. This helped reduce incident triage time by <strong>40%</strong>, significantly boosting the 
                    efficiency of our support teams. <br/>

                    <ListGroup.Item>
                    o I also built time series forecasting models (Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) to predict infrastructure metrics 
                    like bandwidth and device load‚Äîthese models improved our capacity planning accuracy by over <strong>30%</strong>. <br/>

                    o During this phase, I focused on building an anomaly detection system for network packet drops and TCP anomalies. 
                    The model achieved <strong>92% precision</strong>, helping cut false alerts by <strong>40%</strong> and making monitoring way more reliable 
                    across <strong>500+ client devices</strong>.<br />

                    o Here, I led the design of a centralized data lake (HDFS/YARN) serving <strong>15+ TB</strong> of structured data across 
                    10+ teams. I also optimized legacy SQL queries for Hive and Impala, cutting their runtime by <strong>60%</strong>. <br/>
