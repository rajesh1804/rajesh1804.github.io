              <p>
                ðŸš• RideCastAI is a real-time ML-powered prediction engine built for ride-hailing platforms like Uber or Lyft. It predicts trip <strong>ETA</strong> and <strong>fare ranges (P10, P50, P90)</strong> using real-world NYC data â€” simulating demand, uncertainty, and latency.
              </p>
              <h6>ðŸ’¡ Why it matters:</h6>
              <p>
                Most pricing engines are black-box and static. RideCastAI showcases how <strong>spatio-temporal ML</strong> and <strong>quantile regression</strong> can power real-time, user-facing predictions â€” bridging research with deployment.

              <strong>Description: </strong><br />
              The main objective is to explore the different types of uncertainties involved during training an ensemble
              model as well as those involved during predictions. The idea is to establish a comprehensive
              set of methodologies that track both the aleatoric (data uncertainty) and the epistemic (knowledge
              uncertainty). We start with a theoretical analysis of bayesian inference on an ensemble of probabilistic
              models, for both regression and classification establishing the mathematical definitions to compute the 
              aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Next we generate boosted ensembles
              of GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) using two techniques: SGB (Stochastic Gradient
              Boosting) and SGLB(Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting) as well as bagged ensemble (specifically,
              Random Forests). Subsequently, we will analyze the models using synthetically generated data
              to empirically understand the different attributes of the ensembles for estimating data and knowledge
              uncertainties. Finally, we will evaluate the plausibility of using the uncertainty measures to
              detect errors (Prediction-Rejection Ratio - PRR) and out-of-domain inputs (AUC-ROC) on realworld
              data (such as prediction uncertainty for credit card fraud, uncertainty in prediction of medical
              diagnosis, etc).<br />

              <strong>Description: </strong><br />
              A common problem faced by the anyone wanting to train a machine learning model is obtaining labeled data, where unlabeled 
              data may be abundant, but labels are complex, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. Weak Supervision and Active Learning  
              play a vital role in filling this gap. Weak supervision labels data using weak supervision sources for assigning noisy 
              labels to the unlabeled data. Snorkel, Snuba and ASTRA are the state of the art implementations of weak supervision. 
              On the flip side, Active Learning uses the input from human annotator to generate good quality labels. The key notion 
              behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer labelled training 
              instances if they are allowed to choose the training data from which they learn. Through this study we aim to investigate 
              how different query strategies in Active Learning fare when labeling on a real-world dataset in addition to 2 benchmark 
              datasets. We develop an active learning module that queries instances from unlabeled dataset using multiple strategies on 
              multiple machine learning models. We compare the performance of the active learners to various weak supervision baselines. 
              And, we also try to implement Bayesian optimization on medical dataset to compare against the active learner due to their 
              similarity. Finally, we conclude that the active learner with actively sampled instances outperform the baselines for all 
              the datasets.<br />
